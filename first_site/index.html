    <p class="common">The hand has become <em>increasingly</em> less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only <small>gotten easier</small> to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. <hr>This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will <strong>emphasize the hand-quality of websites</strong> by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. <br>
    We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space. <a </p>
